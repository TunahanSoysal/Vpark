This is a vehicle hiring system
Vehicle Hiring System that serves for the VPark company. 
Basically, there are different types of vehicles, some can be hired for different time periods, with different 
fees and may be with some extra costs. Some certain types of vehicles can be booked for future rentals, 
some can be delivered to the renterâ€™s position to be picked up, and some can be dropped off another 
location rather than the rental office. In some cases, the customer(s) may require a vehicle which can carry 
some extra load for example to move to another city. So, not only car(s), but also trucks can be offered to 
the customers.
